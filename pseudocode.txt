### Understanding and Setting Up the EEG

1. **Install Drivers and APIs**: Download and install the necessary drivers and libraries to interact with the EEG hardware. 
Refer to the documentation to learn how to access the EEG data.
2. **Set Up Communication**: Establish a connection between the EEG and the computer via Bluetooth or USB. Test the connection.


### Acquisition and Processing of EEG Data
1. **Read Raw Data**: Write a script to capture the raw EEG data.
2. **Preprocess the Data**: EEG signals are noisy, so you will need to use filtering techniques to eliminate artifacts and noise. 
Use low-pass or high-pass filters, or signal processing techniques such as Fourier Transform to analyze frequencies.
3. **Extract Features**: Identify relevant features, such as amplitudes or specific frequencies, associated with mental states of 
interest (e.g., concentration, impulse, or relaxation).
4. **Create a Detection Model**: Use machine learning techniques to create a model that can interpret the EEG data. Train the model 
to recognize patterns associated with specific actions (in this case, when you want the character to jump).


### Integration with the Video Game

1. **Develop a Control Interface**: Create an interface in Python that receives the processed EEG data and sends the appropriate commands 
to the game. (Use tools like Pygame for the Python version of Flappy Bird.)
2. **Send Commands to the Game**: Integrate the detection model with the game. When the model detects an intention (such as a jump), it 
should send a signal to make the bird jump.


### Testing and Adjustment

1. **Test the System**: Check how the system reacts to different thoughts or states. Ensure the character responds correctly to the 
EEG signals and adjust the model based on the results.
2. **Adjust the Model and Parameters**: Fine-tune the AI model parameters, detection thresholds, or filters to improve accuracy and 
responsiveness.
3. **Evaluate User Experience**: Ensure that the EEG control is smooth and responsive. Make adjustments to enhance the user experience 
based on feedback received.


### Documentation and Presentation (If Presenting)

1. **Document the Project**: Write detailed documentation on the hardware used, the code, the AI model, and the configuration steps. 
Include diagrams, explanations of algorithms, and instructions for reproducing the project.
2. **Prepare a Presentation**: Create slides showcasing the objectives, process, challenges encountered, and results achieved.
